Kinoko is a reimplementation of Mario Kart Wii's physics engine in C++. This project is a spiritual continuation of [stblr/Hanachan](https://github.com/stblr/Hanachan). Like Hanachan, the goal of this reimplementation is to reach perfectly accurate ghost replay.

To see the current list of test cases and progress, visit [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Building

### Dependencies

- g++ 13.1 (C++23)
- ninja 1.3
- Python 3.6

### Process

Generate the ninja file and test case binary:

```bash
./configure.py
```

Execute it:

```bash
ninja
```

Run Kinoko:

```bash
cd out
./kinoko -s testCases.bin
```

## Creating New Test Cases

Currently, Kinoko runs by iterating over a set of test cases defined in `testCases.json`.

### Create KRKG

Test cases use a custom `.krkg` file format, which stores relevant in-game memory values to validate accuracy on every frame of a race. This file is generated using a custom version of MKW-SP.

1. Navigate to the [workflows](https://github.com/vabold/mkw-sp/actions?query=branch%3Akrkg) page for the KRKG branch of [vabold/mkw-sp](https://github.com/vabold/mkw-sp).
2. Download the `mkw-sp-test` artifact at the bottom of the page.
3. Extract `boot.dol` to a folder of your choosing.
4. In Dolphin, navigate to Config > Paths and set `Default ISO` to the path of your Mario Kart Wii PAL ISO.
5. In Dolphin, click Open and select the extracted `boot.dol`.
6. You should see some debug information printed on-screen and Mario Kart Wii should boot soon after.
7. Watch a ghost replay of your choosing. After the ghost finishes and the screen fades to black, navigate to `[DolphinDir]\User\Wii\title\00010004\524d4345\data`. You should see a new file called `test.krkg`.

### Add Test Case Params

Test cases are defined in `testCases.json` in the following format:

```json
"testCaseName": {
    "rkgPath": "pathTo.rkg",
    "krkgPath": "pathTo.krkg",
    "targetFrame": 0
}
```

`rkgPath` is the path to the game's native ghost file for the time trial you want to simulate. `krkgPath` points to the krkg file generated in the previous section for this time trial ghost. `targetFrame` is the number of frames to attempt sync for this ghost. Kinoko will throw an error if it is larger than the framecount stored in the krkg. If Kinoko reaches `targetFrame` while maintaing sync, then the test case will pass.

To update the test binary, be sure to re-run:

```bash
./configure.py
```

## Interfacing

While a GUI is not planned for the project at this time, contributors are welcome to add a graphics frontend under three conditions: the license must not change, it does not interfere with the CLI, and most importantly, it must **not** distribute any in-game assets.

## Contributing

The codebase uses C++ for the engine and Python for any external scripts.

Pull requests resolving an issue or element of a tracking issue should reference the issue or item in the description.

Any commits should be formatted using the project's clang-format file.
